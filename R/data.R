#' Wee, Newman, & Joseph, (2014) ASVAB data
#'
#' This dataset was published in Wee, S., Newman, D. A., & Joseph, D. L. (2014)
#' and describes the results of a military validation study. The first four
#' rows contain the intercorrelations of the four predictor variables. The fifth
#' row contains the black-white score differences (d). Rows 6-12 contain the 
#' correlations between the four predictor variables and the six job performance
#' variables.

#' This example data was published in Ree, M. J., Carretta, T. R., Earles, J. A.,
#' & Albert, W. (1994). The data set contains two matrices stored as a list,
#' which can be used to demonstrate multivariate range restriction corrections. The
#' vstar matrix is the variance-covariance matrix of the unrestricted sample. The 
#' vpp matrix is the variance covariance matrix of the restricted sample. The 
#' vpp matrix represents the subset of variables which were explicitly used for
#' selection, which are also found in the upper left corner of the vstar matrix.
